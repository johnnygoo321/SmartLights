# SmartLights

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Smart Lights app!

**Creator:** [@johnnycodes_](https://www.instagram.com/johnnycodes_/)

### **Background:**

This project was created with the purpose of locally being able to control an addressable led strip through a Raspberry Pi. We could of used a WLED controller to make things a bit easier, but as a challenge I decided to create my own full stack app ðŸ˜….

### **Tech Stack:**

For the frontend I used **Expo** which allows me to create a mobile app that works with both IOS and Android all through JavaScript. With the backend, **Flask-RESTFul** was used to service any requests made from the app.

### **Working Demo:**

## Hardware

**Please keep in mind these are the items I purchased for this project, you do not have to get the same ones.**

(1) Raspberry Pi 4: [Pi4 64bit 4GB](https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Model-2019-Quad-Bluetooth/dp/B07TC2BK1X/ref=sr_1_3?crid=PIVQ34NEUCQ2&keywords=raspberry%2Bpi%2B4&qid=1701222101&sprefix=raspberry%2Bpi%2B4%2Caps%2C105&sr=8-3&th=1) - This is only the PI, but a Micro SD and Power Supply will be needed).

(2) Addressable LED Strip: [WS2812B RGB Strip](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088FK8NG6?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) - I purchased the White IP67 300LED solely because I like how they look.

(3) LED Strip Power Supply: [ALITOVE 5V 10A Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0852HL336?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) - these work great with the strip.

(4) 12V DC Power Connector (Only need one Female Jack): [DAYKIT DC Power Connector](https://www.amazon.com/DAYKIT-Female-2-1x5-5MM-Adapter-Connector/dp/B01J1WZENK/ref=sr_1_10?crid=3SZBSSG1OAABR&keywords=female+dc+jack+connector&qid=1701313367&sprefix=female+dc+jack+cvonnector%2Caps%2C96&sr=8-10)

(5) Jumper Wires (Only need two Male to Female Wires): [Haitronic Wires](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LZF1ZSZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

(6) Micro SD Reader (May be optional): With the command below, check which OS version your PI is running. If it is running as 32bit (armv7l), then we will need to upgrade to 64bit to run React Native.
Ensure it can be upgraded to 64bit, then follow the tutorial here: [Raspberry Pi 64 bit install](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_j5lcQEvG4)

```
uname -m
```

## Cloning the Repo & Getting Started

**For this you can either connect to the PI and use the terminal from there or SSH (much easier) into it.**

I will assume git, python, pip, node, and npm are already installed on your PI.

Install React Native Expo:

```
npm install expo
```

Clone the Repo

```
git clone https://github.com/johnnygoo321 SmartLights.git
```

Install the necessary dependencies

```
cd SmartLights
```

- Open two terminals side-by-side
- cd into smartLights_app on one

```
npm install
```

- cd into smartLights_server on the other

```
pip3 install requirements.txt
```

## LED Strip Configuration File

Update the configuration as needed in the **smartLights_server/led_config.py** file. 
In reality, you probably only need to change the LED_COUNT and can play around with the LED_BRIGHTNESS.

```python
# LED STRIP DEFAULT CONFIGURATION
LED_COUNT      = 300     # Number of LED's.
LED_PIN        = 18      # GPIO PWM pin connected to the pixels.
LED_FREQ_HZ    = 800000  # LED signal frequency in hertz (usually 800khz)
LED_DMA        = 10      # DMA channel to use for generating a signal (try 10)
LED_BRIGHTNESS = 25      # Set to 0 for darkest and 255 for brightest
LED_INVERT     = False   # True to invert the signal (when using NPN transistor level shift)
LED_CHANNEL    = 0       # set to '1' for GPIOs 13, 19, 41, 45 or 53
```

On top of that, you are going to want to create a .env file in the root of the smartLights_app and smartLights_server folders

```
smartLights_app .env file contents:

IPV4_ADDRESS_OF_PI=http://192.xxx.x.xx
SERVER_PORT=5000
```
```
smartLights_server .env file contents:

IPV4_ADDRESS_OF_PI=192.xxx.x.xx
PORT=5000
```

## Running the App (Locally)

Now that we have the initial setup, let's run this thing! Althought this is a single project, it is best to run the backend in a virutal environment.
This will help prevent package versioning issues across many projects.

```
sudo python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
Start the backend server... First run pwd to get the working directory. We will use this to run the venv with root privledges.

```
pwd
sudo 'your_pwd_here'/.venv/bin/python3 app.py
```
In a separate terminal start the frontend application (keep in mind you need to install expo on your mobile device to scan the QR code)

```
npx start expo
```
Now you can interact with the lights through your mobile device!
